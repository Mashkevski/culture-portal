    "description": "Everyone now feels the richness of Belarusian poetry. But this wealth did not come immediately - it did not accumulate over the years, not even decades, but over the centuries. Like no other, Belarusian literature, Belarusian poetry is associated with the people. And it finds explanation. The Belarusian people were monstrously oppressed by tsarism. Tsarism did not even recognize the Belarusian language. He considered that language is a dialect.
